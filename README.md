# **Water Quality Analysis using Machine Learning**

## **Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to analyze a water quality dataset obtained from Kaggle and apply machine learning algorithms to predict the potability of water based on various chemical characteristics. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, model building for classification, and the creation of a dashboard using Power BI for interactive data analysis and presentation.

## **Objectives**

The main objectives of this project are:

1. Explore and visualize the water quality dataset.
2. Handle missing values and preprocess the data.
3. Perform exploratory data analysis to understand key features affecting water quality.
4. Build and evaluate multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), for classifying water potability.
5. Compare model performance based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. Create an interactive dashboard using Power BI to present the results and insights gained from the analysis.

## **Dataset**

The dataset contains information on various chemical properties of water. The key features are:

- `ph`: pH value of the water.
- `Hardness`: Water hardness.
- `Solids`: Total dissolved solids in ppm.
- `Chloramines`: Chloramine content in ppm.
- `Sulfate`: Sulfate concentration in ppm.
- `Conductivity`: Electrical conductivity of water.
- `Organic_carbon`: Organic carbon content in ppm.
- `Trihalomethanes`: Trihalomethane concentration in ppm.
- `Turbidity`: Measure of water cloudiness.
- `Potability`: Target variable indicating if the water is safe to drink (1) or not (0).
